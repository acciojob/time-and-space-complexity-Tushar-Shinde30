<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases. An efficient algorithm has low time complexity, meaning it can solve problems quickly even for large inputs.</p>

<p>Space Complexity is a measure of the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to solve a problem as a function of the size of the input. It quantifies the amount of memory used by an algorithm during its execution. In Big O notation, Space Complexity is often represented as O(n), where n is the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the maximum amount of memory space required by the algorithm.</p>
